# Explore

An Entity Explorer for visualizing the results of data harmonized using the model created in "Connect".

### Getting Started

Search on entities by entering a term or phrase in the search field.  

You can expand relationships for an entity by right clicking on the entity or by selecting the entity and viewing it's Relationship pane. The Info pane of a selected entity will display the provenance associated with that entity.  You can also take advantage of faceted navigation and toggle between graph and grid views.
